# Practical 2 

Keywords: Classification, Model Tuning, Feature Engineering

In this practical, we classified executable files collected from peopleâ€™s computers
into any of 14 known malware classes, or determine that
the executables are not malware. The training dataset has 3086 executables of known provenance that were collected on a single day. We need to classify the 3724 executables collected on a subsequent day.

It is hard to identify malware because it may behave differently based on the environment in which it finds itself. Therefore, it is important to select good features before considering any models. More details can be found in the final report pdf.
